This is a basic PONG! clone writen in C++ and uses the SFML 2.0 library for graphics and sound.  You will have to have
successfully built SFML on your target machine in order to have the required libraries or DYLIBS for this game to run.

Also, no asset files are included - you will need to create your own splash screen, ball, paddle, and menus as well as
any sound or music.
